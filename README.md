# Sales Forecasting using Prophet

This project demonstrates the use of **Prophet** for time series forecasting of sales data. Prophet is an open-source tool developed by Facebook for forecasting time series data, particularly useful when data exhibits seasonality, trends, and holidays.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict future sales based on historical sales data. This includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Loading and cleaning the sales data.
   - Handling missing values and formatting the data for Prophet.

2. **Modeling with Prophet**: 
   - Using Prophet to create a forecasting model.
   - Handling seasonality and holidays in the sales data.
   - Tuning the model for better performance.

3. **Forecasting and Evaluation**: 
   - Generating forecasts for future sales.
   - Visualizing the forecast with confidence intervals.
   - Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as MAE (Mean Absolute Error) or RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
